# pass_manager
A password manager app to store your data.

Basically this is the GUI app built with python only, using tkinter module.

It has three features of managing password, generating password and notes manager to keep all your notes safe.

Although you need lot install lot of packages like PIL, urlib, requests and much more but I dedcided me make a srcipt to install all of these modules if users don't have them.

You just need to have python installed version 3.7.

tbh I know python is for making apps but I did that anyways don't make that mistake ;)
